        <h1>Calc</h1>

        <p> 1.) How would you describe an object to a non-technical friend you grew up with?<br><br>
            an "object" is kinda like a backpack, it can hold different things inside it and even has different
            compartments for things such as books, pencils, and snacks.<br><br>

            2.) What are some advantages to creating object literals?<br><br>
            Simplicity, preformance, reusabilty, and readability<br><br>

            3.) How do objects differ from arrays?<br><br>
            objects are used to store and access data that has properties, which are named keys and their corresponding
            values.
            arrays are used to store and access a collection of elements that are typically of the same data type, and
            are accessed by their index or position in the array<br><br>

            4.) Give an example for when you would need to use bracket notation to access an objectâ€™s property instead
            of dot notation.<br><br>
            if the property name contains invalid JavaScript identifiers they can't be accessed using dot notation so
            you need to use bracket notation instead<br><br>

            5.) Evaluate the code below. What does the term this refer to and what is the advantage to using this?
            <xmp>
                const dog = {
                name: 'Spot',
                age: 2,
                color: 'white with black spots',
                humanAge: function (){
                console.log(`${this.name} is ${this.age*7} in human years`);
                }
                }
            </xmp>
            "this" refers to the name property of the "dog" object (Spot) and the age property of the "dog" object (2)
            The advantage to using this is that it will let me refer to the current object in my method/function
            without having to explicitly reference it by name makeing my code more reusable and less errorr prone<br><br>

            6.) What is the DOM?<br><br>
            data representation of the objects that comprise the structure and content of a document on the web.<br><br>

            7.) Briefly describe the relationship between the DOM and JavaScript.<br><br>
            JavaScript can be used to manipulate the DOM By accessing and manipulating the nodes in it (the DOM is not a
            programming language)<br><br>

        <h1>What Went Wrong? Troubleshooting JavaScript</h1> 
        
        

1.) Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.<br>
Syntax errors are caused by mistakes in the syntax of the code like a missing bracket or semicolon preventing the code from running at all, Logic errors are mistakes in the actual logic or flow of the code causing unexpected or incorrect results but still allowing the code to run<br><br>

2.) List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.<br>
One type of error I've encountered is a TypeError which happens when trying to perform an operation on a variable of the wrong type. To correct it I had to check the type of the variable and make sure it matched the operation I was trying to perform<br><br>

3.) How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?<br>
it'll save me time and frustration when I get errors, and improve my problem-solving and critical thinking abilities

<h1>The JavaScript Debugger</h1> 

1.) How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?<br>
It's a tool that allows developers to step through their code one line at a time, set breakpoints, and monitor variables/values as the code executes<br><br>

2.)  Define what a breakpoint is.<br>
A point in the code where the execution pauses letting the developer inspect the state of the program and variables at that point<br><br>

3.) What is the call stack?<br>
List of function calls that have been made in the current program

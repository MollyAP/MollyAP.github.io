        <h1>HTML Forms</h1> 
        
<p>
1.) Why are forms so important in web development?<br>
Because they allow users to input data and submit it to the server for processing.<br><br>

2.) When designing a form, what are some key things to keep in mind when it comes to user experience?<br>
They should be easy to fill out, have clear labels, and provide helpful error messages.<br><br>

3.) List 5 form elements and explain their importance.<br>
input: used to collect user input, such as text, numbers, and checkboxes.<br>
label: used to provide a description or label for a form input element.<br>
select: used to create drop-down menus for users to select options from.<br>
textarea: used for collecting longer text inputs from users.<br>
button: used to submit or reset a form.

1.) How would you describe events to a non-technical friend?<br>
Events are actions that happen in the browser, like someone clicking a button or a page finishing loading.<br><br>

2.) When using the addEventListener() method, what 2 arguments will you need to provide?<br>
The event you want to listen for like a click and the function to be executed when the event happens.<br><br>

3.) Describe the event object. Why is the target within the event object useful?<br>
It's an object that contains information about the event that happened like the target element and any user input data. It's useful for determining which element triggered the event.<br><br>

4.) What is the difference between event bubbling and event capturing?<br>
Event bubbling is when the event is first captured by the innermost element and then propagated to outer elements, event capturing is the opposite.

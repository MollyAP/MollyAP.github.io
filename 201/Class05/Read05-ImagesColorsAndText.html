        <h1>Images in HTML</h1>

        In order to put an image on a web page, we use the <mark>< img></mark> element, it can't have any child content or an end tag
        and needs two attributes to be useful, src and alt<br><br>
        
        src contains a URL pointing to the image you want to embed, like href for <mark>< a ></mark>, src can be a relative or absolute, 
        Without an src attribute, an img element has no image to load.<br><br>

        So for example, if your image is called <mark>test.png</mark>, and it sits in the same directory as your HTML page,
        you could embed the image like so:

            <xmp>
        <img src="test.png" alt="Test img" />
            </xmp><br>
           
            If the image was in an images subdirectory, which was inside the same directory as the HTML page, then you'd
            embed it like this:

            <xmp>
        <img src="images/test.png" alt="Test img" />
            </xmp><br>
            
            Though not reccomended you can even embed the image using its absolute URL like this:

            <xmp>
        <img src="https://www.example.com/images/test.png" alt="Test img" />
            </xmp>

            Hosting your own images by keeping them on the same server as your HTML is preffered but In more advanced setups, you might use a 
            CDN (Content Delivery Network) to deliver your images.<br><br>

            The above code examples would all look like this:

            <img src="test.png" alt="Test img" />

            <h1>Colors in CSS</h1>

            <strong>color:</strong>  defines the foreground color of an HTML element's content<br><br>

            <strong>background-color:</strong> defines the element's background color<br><br>

            <h2>Text</h2>
            Whenever an element is rendered, these properties are used to determine the color, background,` and any decorations of the text<br><br>

            <strong>color:</strong> The color to use for text and text decorations (under or overlines, strike-through lines, etc)<br><br>

            <strong>background-color:</strong> The text's background color<br><br>

            <strong>text-shadow:</strong> Puts a shadow effect on text, you can also change the shadow's base color, which is then blurred and 
            blended with the background based on the other parameters<br><br>

            <strong>text-decoration-color:</strong> text decorations use the color property as their colors by default but you can override 
            that and use a different color for them with the text-decoration-color property<br><br>

            <strong>text-emphasis-color:</strong> color used when drawing emphasis symbols adjacent to each character in the text, used 
            primarily with text for East Asian languages.<br><br>

            <strong>caret-color:</strong> color used for a caret (the text input cursor) within the element. This is only useful in elements 
            that are editable, such as <mark>< input ></mark> and <mark>< textarea ></mark> or elements whose HTML <mark>contenteditable</mark> 
            attribute is set.<br><br>

            <strong>boxes:</strong> every element is a box with content, and has a background and a border in addition to whatever 
            contents the box may have.<br><br>

            <strong>borders:</strong> allows you to edit the property of the box's outline<br><br>
            
            <strong>background-color:</strong> color to use in areas of the element that have no foreground content<br><br>
            
            <strong>column-rule-color:</strong> color used when drawing the line separating columns of text<br><br>

            <strong>outline-color:</strong> color used when drawing an outline around the outside of the element, outlines are 
            different from borders since they dont get space set aside for them in the document meaning overlapping other 
            content is possible, it's generally used as a focus indicator, to show which element will receive input events.<br><br>

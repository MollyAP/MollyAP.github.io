        <h1>Video and Audio Content</h1>



        1.) Explain how the ability to use video and audio on the web has evolved since the early 2000s.<br>
        The ability to use video and audio on the web has evolved significantly since the early 2000s. In the past,
        plugins like Flash were used to display video and audio content, but now browsers support HTML5 video and audio
        tags, making it easier to embed media directly on web pages. Additionally, improvements in internet speeds have
        made it possible to stream high-quality video and audio content without buffering.<br><br>

        2.) Describe the use of the src and controls attributes in the < video> element.<br>
            The src attribute is used to specify the URL of the video file, while the controls attribute enables
            standard video playback controls, such as play, pause, and volume. <br><br>

            3.) Why is it important to have fallback content inside the < video> element?<br>
                Because not all browsers support the < video> tag or certain video codecsand by providing fallback
                    content users with unsupported browsers or codecs can still access the content.<br><br>

                    4.) Write a very short story where < audio> and < video> are characters.<br>
                            Once upon a time there were two sisters who loved to perform named Audio and Video. Audio
                            had a beautiful voice and Video was a skilled dancer and together they traveled the world,
                            entertaining audiences with their talent.

                            <h1>A Complete Guide To Grid</h1>

                            1.) How does Grid layout differ from Flex?<br>
                            Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional layouts like rows or columns and Grid is designed
                            for two-dimensional layouts with rows and columns.<br><br>

                            2.) Grid container, grid item, and grid line are a few important terms to understand when
                            using Grid. Please describe these terms in a few sentences.<br>
                            The grid container is the element that holds all the grid items which are the individual
                            elements inside the container that are laid out using the grid system and grid lines are the
                            horizontal and vertical lines that define the rows and columns of the grid layout.

                            <h1>Responsive Images</h1>

                            1.) Besides making a site visually appealing across different screen sizes, why should
                            developers make images responsive?<br>
                            To improve site performance and user experience as Large high-resolution images can slow
                            down page load times.<br><br>

                            2.) Define the following < img> attributes srcset and sizes. Write an example of how they
                                are used.<br>
                                The srcset attribute is used to specify multiple versions of an image at different
                                resolutions, while the sizes attribute specifies the width of the image container. For
                                example, <img src="image.jpg" srcset="image-480w.jpg 480w, image-800w.jpg 800w"
                                    sizes="(max-width: 600px) 480px, 800px"> specifies two versions of the image with
                                widths of 480px and 800px, and tells the browser to use the smaller version on screens
                                up to 600px wide.<br><br>

                                3.) How is srcset more helpful for responsive images than CSS or JavaScript?<br>
                                Because it allows the browser to select the appropriate image based on the device's
                                screen size and resolution.

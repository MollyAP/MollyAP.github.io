        <h1>Domain Modeling</h1>

        Explain why we need domain modeling.<br>
        To conceptualize what we need for code

        <h1>HTML Table Basics</h1>

        Why should tables not be used for page layouts?<br>
        rigid, unappealing, clunky, and not fluid

        List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML < table><br>
            < td>, < tr>, and < th>

                        <h1>Introducing Constructors</h1>

                        What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?<br>
                        A fucntion that allows you to create an object<br><br>


                        How does the term this differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?<br>
                        literal is one object one time and constructers apply to everything<br><br>

                        <h1>Object Prototypes Using A Constructor</h1>

                        Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience.
                        NOTE: This is a very common front end developer interview question<br><br>

                        I work at Lowes and you had a customer who wanted to buy a riding mower, I showed them a John
                        Deere S180 which had all the features you'd expect of a lawn mower such as... cutting grass, but
                        they want something "more advanced" with extra features like being able to handle snow but we
                        don't have such a mower in stock (no one does) but after some research I inform the customer
                        that It's possible to make that modification himself as we sell a snowplow attachment for that
                        mower on our website. the basic model to add the extra features they need, In this JavaScript
                        analogy objects are like mowers and prototypes are like the basic model which has all the
                        essential features that all other mowers will have aka the template for creating new mowers
                        (objects) and when the customer and I modify the basic model to add extra features (adding the
                        snowplow attachment), we are creating a new object that inherits the properties and methods of
                        the prototype and we can add new properties and methods to it without modifying the original.

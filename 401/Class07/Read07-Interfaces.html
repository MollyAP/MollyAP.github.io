    <h2>Why it matters:</h2>
    Interfaces matter because C# lacks support for multiple class inheritance, meaning you can only inherit from a
    single class. Interfaces on the other hand let us define a contract / set of behaviors that a class or struct must
    implement and include behavior from multiple sources in a single class without the need for multiple inheritance
    making interfaces ideal for code reusability, modularity, and maintaining a flexible and scalable codebase.

    Things I want to know more about:

    <ol>
      <li>How are interfaces used in real-world C# projects to achieve practical goals?</li>
      <li>How do interfaces work with unit testing and mock object creation in C# projects?</li>
      <li>How does this matter in regards to other concepts like polymorphism?</li>
    </ol>

    <h1>Introduction to Databases and ERDs</h1>

    <h2>Why it matters:</h2>
    This matters because data models are essential for data organization, integrity, and application development and
    contribute to the overall efficiency, scalability, and security, they make sure that data is managed effectively
    throughout its lifecycle.

    <h2>Data Models (Review the DB Schema)</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>Do some research on what a Database Schema is.<br><br>
        <ul>
          <li>What is a Schema?</li>
          <span style="color: #ffffff;">Something that defines the framework for how data will be stored, accessed, and
            managed in a database.</span><br><br>
          <li>Why do we use them?</li>
          <span style="color: #ffffff;">To organize data, for data integrity, for better security, and for
            consistency.</span><br><br>
          <li>What do they look like?</li>

          </span><br><br>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>What are the different types of Database Keys?<br><br>
        <ul>
          <li>What is a Primary Key?</li>
          <span style="color: #ffffff;">A unique identifier for each record in a table that ensures each row is uniquely
            identifiable and serves as a reference for relationships with other tables.</span><br><br>
          <li>What is a Foreign Key?</li>
          <span style="color: #ffffff;">A field in one table that refers to the primary key of another table and
            establishes a link between the two tables and enforces referential integrity.</span><br><br>
          <li>What is a Composite Key?</li>
          <span style="color: #ffffff;">A combination of two or more columns that together form a unique identifier for
            a record in a table.</span><br><br>
          <li>How are they different? When do you use 1 over the others?</li>
          <span style="color: #ffffff;"><br>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Primary Key:

                <span style="color: #ffffff;">
                  The primary key uniquely identifies each record in a table and ensures data integrity. It cannot
                  contain duplicate or null values. Every table should have a primary key.
                </span>
              </li><br>

              <li>
                Foreign Key:

                <span style="color: #ffffff;">
                  The foreign key is used to establish relationships between tables. It references the primary key of
                  another table, creating a link between the two tables. It helps maintain referential integrity and
                  ensures that the data between related tables remains consistent.
                </span>
              </li><br>

              <li>
                Composite Key:

                <span style="color: #ffffff;">
                  A composite key is used when a single column cannot uniquely identify a record, but a combination of
                  columns can. It is used to create a unique identifier for a table by using multiple fields together.
                </span>
              </li><br>

              Use a primary key when you need a unique identifier for each record in a table.
              Use a foreign key when establishing relationships between tables to ensure data consistency and integrity.
              Use a composite key when a single column cannot guarantee uniqueness, but a combination of columns can
              create a unique identifier.
            </ol>
          </span><br><br>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>DBMS</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>What are Relationships in a relational database?<br><br>
        <ul>
          <li>What is a 1:1 relationship?</li>
          <span style="color: #ffffff;">One record in a table is associated with only one corresponding record in
            another table, and vice versa.</span><br><br>

          <li>What is a Many:Many relationship?</li>
          <span style="color: #ffffff;">Multiple records in one table are associated with multiple records in another
            table.</span><br><br>

          <li>How about a 1: Many or a Many:1?</li>
          <span style="color: #ffffff;">A single record in one table is associated with multiple records in another
            table, but each record in the second table is associated with only one record in the first table, or vice
            versa.</span><br><br>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>

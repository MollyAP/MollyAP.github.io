        <h2>Why it matters:</h2>
        Stack and Heap memory management is really important for me to understand because I need to understand how
        variables and objects are allocated, accessed, and deallocated. Value Types and Reference Types, are also
        importanat to understand because it directly relates to the way objects are stored and accessed in memory.
        Understanding the differences between these types helps me decide the right data structures and variable types.
        It also sheds light on the behavior of variables and what happens when passing them by value or reference, which
        is important if i want to write bug-free code.

        <h2>Properties</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <h3>What's the difference between a static and an instance constructor?</h3>
      <p>Static constructors are called only once per type, regardless of the number of instances created and an instance constructor is called each time a new instance of the class is created. Also static constructors are used to initialize static members of a class while instance constructors initialize instance members.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>How does the use of a static constructor differ from setting properties/values?</h3>
      <p>A static constructor initializes static members of a class, while setting properties/values is usually done by instance constructors or by directly assigning values to properties or fields after creating an instance of the class.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Stack and Heap</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <h3>Knowing what you now know about the stack and the heap, how might you rethink the way you did projects in previous courses, to make more efficient use of memory?</h3>
      <p>I would use value types instead of reference types whenever I can.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Garbage Collection Fundamentals</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <h3>Compare "Garbage Collection" in C# with the lifecycle of normal household items.</h3>
      <p>When a household item reaches the end of its usefulness or becomes obsolete, we dispose of it to free up space and keep our place clean. In C#, objects that are no longer needed or have completed their tasks are disposed of to release the memory resources they occupy. </p>
    </li>
  </ol>

        <h2>Things I want to know more about:</h2>

        Things I want to know more about:

        <ol>
            <li>Can objects be stored on the stack, or are they always allocated on the heap?</li>
            <li>How does the passing of value types and reference types to methods affect memory usage?</li>
            <li>How does the garbage collector in C# determine which objects are eligible for collection?</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Why it matters:</h2>
        Since we're studying complicted new stuff like .NET, C#, and SQL, debugging is something that will be VERY
        important because it helps identify and resolve errors and bugs in our code.<br>
        unit tests let us:
        <ol>
            <li>
                Verify the correctness and reliability of individual sections of code.
            </li>

            <li>
                Learning how to use xUnit.net allows us to integrate unit testing seamlessly into your .NET projects and
                by understanding the concepts and techniques of xUnit.net, we can write effective and efficient tests
                for our code.
            </li>

            <li>
                When you're working in a team, unit tests help a lot because they give a standardized and reliable way
                to validate changes made by different team members.
            </li>
        </ol>
        By learning how to make tests with xUnit we will begin to adopt testdriven development practices, better
        cooperate in team projects, and validate interactions with databases.<br>

        <h2>Things I want to know more about:</h2>

        Things I want to know more about:

        <ol>
            <li>How is xunit different from other unit testing frameworks? Why are there more than one??</li>
            <li>Can youu make a program for xunit testing instead of having to use the console?</li>
        </ol>

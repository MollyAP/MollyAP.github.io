    <h2>Why it matters:</h2>

    LINQ matters because it lets developers write queries using syntax that looks almost like regular language, so it's
    more readable and maintainable for english speakers like me. It also enables seamless integration of querying
    capabilities directly into the C# language, making it easier to work with various data sources such as collections,
    databases, XML etc. By understanding LINQ, I will be able to perform common data manipulation tasks like filtering,
    sorting, grouping, projecting, and aggregating data without the need for complex loops or custom methods.

    <h2>Things I want to know more about:</h2>

    Things I want to know more about:

    <ol>
      <li>How does LINQ handle database queries and translate them into SQL commands?</li>
      <li>Can LINQ be used with NoSQL databases and other non-traditional data sources?</li>
      <li>How can I use LINQ with async/await for asynchronous data operations?</li>
    </ol>

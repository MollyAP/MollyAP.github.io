    <h2>Why it matters:</h2>
    Abstraction is important because it allows us to model complex real-world entities as classes, focusing only on the
    relevant attributes and interactions. By abstracting away unneded details, we can create a clear and simplified
    representation of a system, making it easier to understand and manage. Hiding the internal state and functionality
    of an object through encapsulating data within classes is also important because it provides controlled access
    through public interfaces, ensures data integrity, enhances code maintainability, and reduces dependencies.

        <h2>Why it matters:</h2>
        Deliberate practice and upgrading technical skills matters because in the software development field, continuous
        improvement and staying up-to-date with the latest technologies and practices are essential not only for
        professional growth and career advancement but also to keep your job.

        Deliberate practice allows us to push ourselves outside of our comfort zones, and seek challenges that really
        will enhance our skills. By engaging in deliberate practice, we can overcome obstacles, learn new techniques,
        and improve our problem-solving abilities.<br>

        <h2>Summarize and explain this topic via an analogy:</h2>
        Think of it like a Chef fresh out of college, they love cooking and have mastered the cullinary arts. They can
        cook pasta or bake a cake easy BUT if they want to elevate their culinary skills and expand their repertoire,
        they need to challenge themselves with more complex recipes.Deliberate practice for them might involve
        attempting a gourmet French dish. These challenges would take them
        outside their comfort zone, require intense mental focus, and demand attention to detail. By repeatedly working
        on difficult recipes, they would improve their skills, broaden their knowledge, and become a more versatile
        chef.

        this is 1 to 1 with software development, deliberate practice entails thinkinkg of challenging projects that go
        beyond your current skill set. It involves tackling problems that push your boundaries, understanding different
        aspects of the technology stack, and honing your problem-solving abilities. By repeatedly engaging in deliberate
        practice, we can enhance our technical skills, become more proficient programmers, and excel in our chosen
        field.<br>

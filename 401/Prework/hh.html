        <h2>Discussion Questions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best
                suited to solve a particular problem?
            </li>

            <li>
                How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?
            </li>
        </ol><br>

        <h2>Summarize and explain this topic via an analogy:</h2>
        Think of it like a Chef fresh out of college, they love cooking and have mastered the cullinary arts. They can
        cook pasta or bake a cake easy BUT if they want to elevate their culinary skills and expand their repertoire,
        they need to challenge themselves with more complex recipes.Deliberate practice for them might involve
        attempting a gourmet French dish. These challenges would take them
        outside their comfort zone, require intense mental focus, and demand attention to detail. By repeatedly working
        on difficult recipes, they would improve their skills, broaden their knowledge, and become a more versatile
        chef.

        this is 1 to 1 with software development, deliberate practice entails thinkinkg of challenging projects that go
        beyond your current skill set. It involves tackling problems that push your boundaries, understanding different
        aspects of the technology stack, and honing your problem-solving abilities. By repeatedly engaging in deliberate
        practice, we can enhance our technical skills, become more proficient programmers, and excel in our chosen
        field.<br>

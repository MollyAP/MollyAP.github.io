        <h2>Why it matters:</h2>
        These topics are crucial for understanding how to correctly perform input/output operations in my future
        programming projects because reading and writing data is pretty much a fundamental part of most apps and such.
        The articles give me detailed explanations of the System.IO namespaces, which contain essential classes and
        methods for handling files, directories, streams, readers, writers, compression, etc. with this info I can now
        manipulate data stored in files, create new files, read and write text or binary data, and perform operations
        such as copying, moving, and deleting files and directories.

        <h2>Things I want to know more about:</h2>

        Things I want to know more about:

        <ol>
            <li>Are there any specific performance considerations I should keep in mind when working with large files or performing intensive I/O operations? How can I optimize the reading and writing processes to improve efficiency?</li>
            <li>Are there any security things i should worry about when working with file operations?</li>
            <li>How do I work with file paths that contain special characters, spaces, or non-ASCII characters?</li>
          </ol>

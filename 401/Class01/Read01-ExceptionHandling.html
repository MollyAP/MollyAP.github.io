        <h2>Why it matters:</h2>
        Since we're studying complicted new stuff like .NET, C#, and SQL, debugging is something that will be VERY
        important because it helps identify and resolve errors and bugs in our code.<br>
        Understanding how debugging works lets us:
        <ol>
            <li> Pinpoint the exact location that errors happen in our code, which will come in handy when working with
                complex apps that involve multiple components or databases. </li>

            <li> Identify incorrect logic, faulty queries, or unexpected behavior, so we can then make the necessary
                corrections.</li>

            <li> Save time and effort wasted by trial and error or scanning through code for hours when troubleshooting,
                because we can just set breakpoints, examine variables, step through code execution, and track the flow
                of data, which is a way more efficient way of doing things.</li>

            <li>think critically and analytically, ask the right questions, examine assumptions, and approach problems
                systematically. All of which are skills that are transferable and valuable in our future workplaces</li>
        </ol>
        By learning how to properly debug we become better equipped to create robust and functional applications using
        .NET, C#, and SQL.<br>

        <h2>Summarize and explain this topic via an analogy from my previous work or home experience:</h2>
        When I worked at Lowes a customer brought back a lawn mower they bought the previous day giving us an ultimatum,
        fix it or loose their money, when i think back on it debugging can definetly be compared to what i did:
        <ol>
            <li>
                Clarify the problem: The customer brings in a broken lawn mower and explains that it won't start or run
                even though they bought it the day before. To begin the real life debug, I clarified the specific issue
                and I understood what the customer expected the lawn mower to do v.s. what was actually happening.
            </li>

            <li>
                Examine my assumptions: Since they had JUST bought it and it had NEVER been used I assumed that it had
                all the necessary components intact, the fuel tank had been filled, and the spark plug was functioning.
                After identifying these assumptions I could then avoid overlooking these easy to miss problems.
            </li>

            <li>
                Step through the troubleshooting process: Just like stepping through code in debugging mode, I
                systematically went through all of the mower's various components. Checked the fuel line, examined the
                air filter, inspected the carburetor, i even reviewed the ignition system! Observing each part and its
                behavior helped me in pinpointing where the problem could be occurring.
            </li>

            <li>
                Make corrections: I finally identified the issue, some of the handle was still pushed into the body! Ths
                is something that the manufacturer does to fit the mower in the box but it also blocks the blades from
                spinning, it was an easy fix.
            </li>
        </ol>

    <h2>Why it matters:</h2>

    It matters because it provides a easy structured way to manage and fulfill dependencies between various parts of my
    app. In the real world apps aren't built as single, large, and tightly integrated peices... instead they're made of
    various classes and modules that interact with each other. They facilitate the management of these interactions by
    decoupling components and allowing them to be independently developed, tested, and replaced. This results in more
    modular, maintainable, and testable code!

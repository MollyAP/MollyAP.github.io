    <h2>Why it matters:</h2>

    <h2>Things I want to know more about:</h2>

    It matters because it provides a easy structured way to manage and fulfill dependencies between various parts of my
    app. In the real world apps aren't built as single, large, and tightly integrated peices... instead they're made of
    various classes and modules that interact with each other. They facilitate the management of these interactions by
    decoupling components and allowing them to be independently developed, tested, and replaced. This results in more
    modular, maintainable, and testable code!

    Things I want to know more about:

    <ol>
      <li>How does dependency injection work in scenarios with highly complex object graphs?</li>
      <li>How does the process of replacing the default service container with a custom one affect application behavior?</li>
      <li>How does Orchard Core's modular and multi-tenant approach impact large-scale application development?</li>
    </ol>

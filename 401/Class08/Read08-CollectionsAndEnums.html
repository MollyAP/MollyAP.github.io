    <h2>Why it matters:</h2>

    Collections matter because they really help a lot in managing groups of related objects quickly and efficiently, allowing us
    to store, retrieve, and manipulate data, so we can handle large amounts of information and adapt to changing

    stacks etc, and each have specific use cases and advantages.

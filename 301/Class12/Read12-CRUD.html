        <h1>Status Codes Based On REST Methods</h1>

        <ol type="1">
            <li>In your own words, describe what each group of status code represents:</li>
            <ul>
            <li>100’s =<a style="color: #ffffff;">The server has received the request and is continuing the process.</a></li>
            <li>200’s =<a style="color: #ffffff;">The server successfully processed the request.</a></li>
            <li>300’s =<a style="color: #ffffff;">The client needs to take further action to complete the request.</a></li>
            <li>400’s =<a style="color: #ffffff;">There was an error on the client-side.</a></li>
            <li>500’s =<a style="color: #ffffff;">There was an error on the server-side.</a></li>
            </ul><br><br>

            <li>What is a status code 202?</li>
            The request was valid, but its processing will finish sometime in the future.<br><br>

            <li>What is a status code 308?</li>
            The resource will now be available at a new URL and the client should directly access it via the new URL in the future.<br><br>

            <li>What code would you use if an update didn’t return data to a client?</li>
            204 No Content.<br><br>

            <li>What code would you use if a resource used to exist but no longer does?</li>
            410 Gone.<br><br>

            <li>What is the ‘Forbidden’ status code?</li>
            403.<br><br>
        </ol>

        <h1>Build A REST API With Node.js, Express, & MongoDB</h1>

        <ol type="1">
            <li>Why do we need to pull our MongoDB database string out of our server and put it into our .env?</li>
            For security reasons, storing sensitive information like database credentials in an .env will protect it from being exposed in case the server code gets seen. <br><br>

            <li>What is middleware?</li>
            Code that runs when the server gets a request but before it gets passed to your routes<br><br>

            <li>What does <mark>app.use(express.json())</mark> do?</li>
            Adds middleware that parses incoming requests with JSON payloads.<br><br>

            <li>What does the <mark>/:id</mark> mean in a route?</li>
            It's a route parameter.<br><br>

            <li>What is the difference between <mark>PUT</mark> and <mark>PATCH</mark>?</li>
            PUT is used to completely replace an existing resource with the provided data while PATCH is used to partially update an existing resource.<br><br>

            <li>How do you make a default value in a schema?</li>
            Use the "default" property in it<br><br>

            <li>What does a <mark>500</mark> error status code mean?</li>
            There was an unexpected error on the server-side while attempting to connect<br><br>

            <li>What is the difference between a status <mark>200</mark> and a status <mark>201</mark>?</li>
            Both mean that the request was successful but 200 means that the server has returned the requested resource while 201 means that a new resource has been created.<br><br>
        </ol>


        <h1>Why it matters</h1>
        <p>Because status codes provide important info about the request outcome from whatever website you're on,
            allowing you to troubleshoot and debug easily.
        </p>

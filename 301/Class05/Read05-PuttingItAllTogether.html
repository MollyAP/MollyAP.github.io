        <h1>React Docs - Thinking in React</h1>

        <ol type="1">
            <li>What is the <mark>single responsibility principle</mark> and how does it apply to components?</li>
            Components should ideally only have one responsibility, aka it should only do one thing, It applies to
            components because each component should perform a specific task<br><br>

            <li>What does it mean to build a ‘static’ version of your application?</li>
            It means building a version of the application without any interactivity<br><br>

            <li>Once you have a static application, what do you need to add?</li>
            Interactivity and State<br><br>

            <li>What are the three questions you can ask to determine if something is state?</li>
            <ul>
                <li style="color: #ffffff;">Does it remain unchanged over time</li>
                <li style="color: #ffffff;">Is it passed in from a parent via props</li>
                <li style="color: #ffffff;">Can you compute it based on existing state or props in your component</li>
            </ul><br><br>

            <li>How can you identify where state needs to live?</li>
            Keep the filter text and checked state values<br><br>
        </ol>


        <h1>Higher-Order Functions</h1>

        <ol type="1">
            <li>What is a “higher-order function”?</li>
            Functions that operate on other functions either by taking them as arguments or by returning them<br><br>

            <li>Explore the <mark>greaterThan</mark> function as defined in the reading. In your own words, what is line 2 of this function doing?</li>
            Line two of the function is returning m as it being greater than n<br><br>

            <li>Explain how either <mark>map</mark> or <mark>reduce</mark> operates, with regards to higher-order functions.</li>
            Reduce computes a single value from an array and builds a value by repeatedly taking a single element from the array and combining it with the current value<br><br>
